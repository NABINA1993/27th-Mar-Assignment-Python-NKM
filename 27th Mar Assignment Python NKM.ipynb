    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a dataset with two input features, x1 and x2, and a single output variable, y. We want to train a linear regression model to predict y based on x1 and x2. We start by fitting a simple linear regression model:\n",

The effect of the regularization term is to force the model to have smaller coefficients, which reduces the impact of noisy or irrelevant features and improves its generalization performance.\n",

    "One limitation of regularized linear models is that they assume a linear relationship between the input features and the output variable. If the relationship is nonlinear, then regularized linear models may not be able to capture it effectively, leading to poor predictive performance. In such cases, more complex models, such as decision trees or neural networks, may be more appropriate.\n",

    "Another limitation of regularized linear models is that they can be sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters, such as the regularization parameter. If the regularization parameter is set too high, then the model may underfit the data, while if it is set too low, then the model may overfit the data. Finding the right balance between bias and variance can be challenging, especially in high-dimensional data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularized linear models can also be affected by multicollinearity, which occurs when two or more input features are highly correlated. In such cases, the regularization term may not be able to distinguish between the correlated features, leading to unstable or unreliable coefficient estimates.\n",
